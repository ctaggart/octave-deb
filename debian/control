Description: GNU Octave language for numerical computations
 Octave is a (mostly Matlab (R) compatible) high-level language, primarily
 intended for numerical computations. It provides a convenient command-line
 interface for solving linear and nonlinear problems numerically.
 .
 Octave can be dynamically extended with user-supplied C++ files.
